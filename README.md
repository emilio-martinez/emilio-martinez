Iâ€™m Emilio â€“ a Mexican-American software developer and creative technologist, based in the SF Bay Area.

I love breaking down problems to their core to build thoughtful, scalable, and accessible solutions with users at heart. Whatâ€™s more, I believe in learning + building with other disciplines to make what we do smarter, more informed, and resilient.

I contribute across the stack, enjoy digging into build tools, and believe in adopting the right tools for the job â€” with a healthy use of web standards, of course.
